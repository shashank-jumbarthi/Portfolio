# Shashank Jumbarthi - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my background, skills, projects, and achievements as I pursue a career in cybersecurity.

# About the Website

This portfolio website highlights my journey from being a cybersecurity student. It features the following sections:

- About Me: An overview of my background, including my transition from the Navy to cybersecurity.
- Skills: A display of technical and professional skills with interactive icons that pop out when hovered over—even if you quickly slide your cursor across multiple icons.
- Projects: Personal projects that demonstrate my coding proficiency and problem-solving abilities.
- Achievements: A summary of academic and extracurricular accomplishments, including certifications and club involvement.
- Contact: Clickable links for connecting via LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and phone.

# Tech Stack

This website was built using:

- HTML: For the site structure.
- CSS: For styling, layout, and responsive design.
- JavaScript: For interactive animations (e.g., the sticky pop effect on skill icons).
- *Google Fonts: For enhanced typography.
- Devicon CDN: For the technology icons.

# Features

- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Smooth Scrolling Navigation: Easy access to each section.
- Interactive Skill Icons: When you hover over a skill icon, it scales up by 40% (to 140% of its original size). JavaScript adds a temporary pop effect, so multiple icons can pop out briefly if you slide your mouse quickly.
- Project Cards: Each project includes a description and a link to its GitHub repository.
- Clickable Contact Information: Easily accessible links for connecting via LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and phone.

# How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zachary200114/portfolio-website.git
   Open index.html in your browser to view the website.
   JavaScript Functionality
   The website uses JavaScript to create a "sticky pop" effect on the skill icons. When your cursor enters a skill icon, the icon temporarily scales up by 40%, even if you quickly slide your mouse across several icons. Here's the key JavaScript snippet used:
   ```

javascript
Copy
const icons = document.querySelectorAll('.skill-logo');
icons.forEach(icon => {
icon.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
icon.classList.add('pop');
// Remove the pop effect after 500ms (adjustable)
setTimeout(() => {
icon.classList.remove('pop');
}, 500);
});
});
This code allows multiple icons to remain popped out briefly, enhancing the interactive experience.

Future Improvements
Enhance animations and other interactive elements.
Implement a dynamic contact form.
Optimize performance further for faster load times.
Improve accessibility for a wider range of users.
